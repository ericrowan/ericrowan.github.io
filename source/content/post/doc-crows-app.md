## The Challenge

Capture guest demographics and discover areas for improvement.

Doc Crow's asked the Mocura team to design and develop a mobile experience that would redefine the way they capture guest feedback and demographic information.

## The Solution

Get rid of those sticky pencils and comment cards collecting dust.

We worked closely with Doc Crow's to create a custom iPad survey app to be handed to guests prior to paying their bill. With the use of focused questions and an easy-to-use interface, the user experience became effortless and quite enjoyable. Paying close attention to the client's brand, we were able to create a uniqe frone-end experience coupled with a real-time analytics dashboard to help make sense of all the incoming data.

# Real-time analytics to make sense of it all.
