              shared a lead role in visual design and helped to build the

              expand my existing knowledge of CSS/Sass through the CSS-in-JS

              entice wholesalers to partner with the company.

              ><br />After 23 years, a local telecom company had expanded into a
              national brand and needed to modernize their flagship SaaS
              product, Answer Automation. This was the perfect opportunity to
              study the product&#8217;s use and its potential to become a
              critical reporting tool for Indatus&#8217; most valuable pool of
              customers: property managers and maintenance staff in multifamily
              communities. Over the next two years, I took a deep dive into the
              brand, developing standards and marketing materials while
              rewriting Answer Automation&#8217;s front-end code in Bootstrap
              and Angular &mdash; also creating a complimentary mobile
              maintenance app by request. The platform scaled well and was
              quickly adopted by over 12,000 property management companies.
              Indatus was acquired in April 2015.

              ><br />A multi-part freelance project for a world leader in
              medical equipment and technology, Roche Diagnostics approached me
              to build a suite of microsites to promote some of their
              cutting-edge products. I worked closely with their marketing team
              to ensure all content was presented as intended, while also having
              full creative control in the overall design and look and feel.
              This project is notable due to the visibility of working with a
              global company, as well as pushing myself to gain a better
              understanding of the possibilities of JavaScript and interactive
              design.

              metro population of 1.8+ million residents, Nashville, Tennessee
              needed a fresh municipal portal to better serve its citizens.
              While working on this project with Net Tango in Louisville,
              Kentucky, I found myself in a conundrum after being presented with
              RFP mockups from the design team: The concepts put forth were
              dated &mdash; lacking scalability and defying other best practices
              &mdash; which would limit our objective to help modernize the
              site. Working within a tight deadline, I redirected the team
              toward new, more accessible designs which were eagerly approved by
              the client. Completed in 2012, and still living online in its
              original form, it is fair to assume this intervention was a
              success.

              factor in the company&#8217;s successful branding and marketing
              campagins. This claim is somewhat proven by the fact that at least
              one engineer was swayed to work for the company when they saw and
              appreciated the attention to craft and detail put into the
              marketing website and materials. It was my first time using Kirby,
              a file-based CMS, where I developed a greater understanding of PHP
              basics due to the scrappy nature of the fledlging CMS.

          Web Design course for Code Louisville. By 2015, that partnership had
          become nationally recognized and praised, resulting in a visit to the
          Indatus headquarters by President Obama.
