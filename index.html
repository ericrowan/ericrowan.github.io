        <p><strong>Case Stories</strong></p>

        <ul class="case-studies">

          <li>
            <p><a href="http://indatus.com/solutions/answer-automation/">Answer Automation</a><br> A platform used by over 12,000 multifamily housing customers, Answer Automation was the flagship SaaS product at Indatus that factored heavily into the company
              being acquired by Realpage in 2015. My work on the project spanned the course of over two years and included the complete redesign and rebuild of the front-end of the app, plus the design of the mobile app including supporting materials
              and branding. The front-end of the webapp was built using Bootstrap and Angular.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="https://erowan.gitlab.io/lightcycler.roche.com/">Roche Diagnostics</a><br> A multi-part freelance project for a world leader in medical equipment and technology, Roche Diagnostics approached me to build a suite of microsites to promote
              some of their cutting-edge products. I worked closely with their marketing team to ensure all content was presented as intended, while also having full creative control in the overall design and look and feel. This project is notable due
              to the visibility of working with a global company, as well as pushing myself to gain a better understanding of the possibilities of JavaScript and interactive design.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.nashville.gov/">Nashville.gov</a><br> With a metro population of 1.8+ million residents, Nashville, Tennessee needed a fresh municipal portal to better serve its citizens. While working on this project with Net Tango in Louisville, Kentucky, I found myself in a conundrum after being presented with RFP mockups from the design team: The concepts put forth were dated &mdash; lacking scalability and defying other best practices &mdash; which would limit our objective to help modernize the site. Working within a tight deadline, I redirected the team toward new, more accessible designs which were eagerly approved by the client. Completed in 2012, and still living online in its original form, it is fair to assume this intervention was a success.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="http://indatus.com/">Indatus.com</a><br> This marketing website&mdash;custom-built with the Kirby CMS&mdash;was a driving factor in the company&#8217;s successful branding and marketing campagins. This claim is somewhat proven by the fact that at least
              one engineer was swayed to work for the company when they saw and appreciated the attention to craft and detail put into the marketing website and materials. It was my first time using Kirby, a file-based CMS, where I developed a greater
              understanding of PHP basics due to the scrappy nature of the fledlging CMS.</p>
