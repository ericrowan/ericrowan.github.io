        <p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

          <li>
            <p><a href="http://indatus.com/solutions/answer-automation/">Answer Automation</a><br> A webapp used by 12,000 US customers, Answer Automation is the flagship SaaS product that ultimately led to Indatus being acquired by Realpage in 2015. My
              work on the project spanned the course of over two years and included the complete redesign and rebuild of the frontend of the app, the design of the mobile app including supporting materials and branding. To date it was the most complex
              project I've had the opportunity to work on.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="https://erowan.gitlab.io/lightcycler.roche.com/">Roche Diagnostics</a><br> A multi-part freelance project for a global leader in medical equipment and technology, Roche Diagnostics approached me to build a suite of microsites to promote
              some of their cutting-edge products. I worked closely with their marketing team to enure all content was presented as intended, but I also had full creative control in the design and look and feel of the websites. This project is notable
              due to the visibility of a major corportation as well as pushing myself to gain a better understanding of the possibilities of Javascript and interactive design.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="http://indatus.com/">Indatus.com</a><br> This marketing website was the driving factor in the company's successful branding and marketing campagins, proved by the fact that at least one engineer was swayed to work for the company
              when they saw and appreciated the thought and attention to craft and detail put into our marketing website.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.nashville.gov/">Nashville.gov</a><br> Nashville, Tennessee, metro population of 1.8+ million people. While working at Net Tango in Louisville, Kentucky, I found myself in a conundrum after seeing mockups that the design
              team working on the project intended to present with the RFP: how could I not speak up about my opinion that the designs looked dated and seriously lacking in accessability? In a super tight timeframe, I stepped up and started from scratch
              on new designs that were approved with very minimal requested changes. Completed in 2012, it is fair to say this website has outlasted many that have come after it.</p>

        <p><strong>Accomplishments</strong></p>

        <p><em>Outreach</em><br> In the fall of 2013, I began teaching a Web Design course with <a href="codelouisville.org">Code Louisville</a>, where I helped introduce methodologies and technologies such as Agile and Git.</p>
        <p>What began as a personal side project grew into a close partnership between Code Louisville and Indatus, eventually attracting the attention of The White House, and on April 2, 2015, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/02/remarks-president-techhire-initiative">President Obama visited Indatus</a>.</p>
